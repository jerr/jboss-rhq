== SonarQube RHQ Plugin:
This plugin has basic monitoring of a SonarQube Server and the projects on it. Once manually inventoried it can verify server availability and inventory projects.

=== Configuration :
To configure it use the *urlBase* property. This is the root url path to your sonarqube server interface (e.g. http://localhost:9000/)

=== Metrics :
For each project you have tow metrics :

* *lastAnalysisTime* : Date of the last analysis of the project
* *lastAnalysisElapsedTime* : Time in seconds since the last analysis of the project.
